# Margarita Recipe Page

Recipe page - This is a page with a recipe of a margarita and a brief description of where the cocktail originated from 

This was created as margarita is a very popular cocktail and it is easy to make, which not everyone realises. Therefore a simple but yet clear page for the making of a margarita was made here. 

This page can be used by anyone who is interested in making a margarita.
